# Motivation
BBS post saving for only author responses, the code is designed for Tianya BBS, you can simply modify it to fit in other BBS

# Codes
Two of them are for vanilla version, need to change the code for specific Post page counts and Tianya BBS Post web link
Another two of them are for improved version that user just need to input the web link, the program will auto calculate the page counts and rename the output file

## Notes
In my local environment, sometimes running is fast, sometime is very slow, might due to the web response time issue; in Google CoLab, it is much faster.

My personal recommendation is 'vanilla_BBS_saving_1.py', which is simple and easy to use, which I provided in the Jupyter Notebook.
